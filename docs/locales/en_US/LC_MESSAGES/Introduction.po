"**Local climate** is affected by key factors such as the type of land "
"surface (vegetation, water, building, impervious, etc.) or the size, the "
"shape, the use and the distribution of the buildings. Thus it is "
"necessary to describe accurately the land fabric in order to better "
"understand climate processes."

"Overall, more than **100 urban indicators** are currently calculated "
"(e.g. compactness and road distance at building scale, volume at block "
"scale, building fraction, mean sky view factor at RSU scale, ...). Note "
"that Geoclimate has first been developed for climate studies but many "
"indicators could also be useful to analyze landscape ecology, land use, "
"habitat conservation planning or any environmental or territory "
"applications."
