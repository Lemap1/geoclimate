"For now we recommend using the last jar package currently being "
"developped, you can get the last `snapshot version "
"<https://nightly.link/orbisgis/geoclimate/workflows/CI_snapshot/master/geoclimate-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT>`_."
" It is consistent with the wiki documentation. If the snapshot version "
"does not work as expected, please create `an issue "
"<https://github.com/orbisgis/geoclimate/issues>`_ explaining the problem "
"met. In this case you can also go to the `GeoClimate releases page "
"<https://github.com/orbisgis/geoclimate/releases>`_ to download the last "
"stable published jar package. Note that the documentation related to this"
" version is different than the current wiki (you should instead refer to "
"the documentation.pdf document that comes along with the GeoClimate "
"version)."
