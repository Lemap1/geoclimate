"The indicators calculated at RSU scale suffer from one problem: the "
"calculation is not exact if a building is located on the border "
"separating two units. It is not a problem because the default RSU used by"
" GeoClimate are Topographical Spatial Units (TSU) having borders that "
"rarely cross the buildings. But if the RSU are regular grid cells, many "
"buildings will be located on cell borders and then the smaller the RSU "
"size compared to the building size, the higher the error."

msgid ""
"To overcome this issue, the indicators can be calculated using a regular "
"rectangular grid using a specific script. This specific script uses "
"specific algorithms for indicator calculation, thus avoiding the problem "
"raised by buildings located on borders in the default algorithm. The "
"limitation is that this calculation is only limited to a given number of "
"indicators/classifications. The exhaustive list is given at the `grid "
"indicator output page <https://github.com/orbisgis/geoclimate/wiki/Grid-"
"indicators>`_."
