"Human activities induce changes on land use and land cover. These changes"
" are most significant in urban areas where topographic features (e.g., "
"building, road) affect the density of impervious surface areas and "
"introduce a range of urban morphological patterns. Those characteristics "
"impact the energy balance and modify the climate locally (e.g., inducing "
"the so-called Urban Heat Island phenomenon)."

"Therefore, there is a need for georeferenced morphological indicators as "
"well as urban classifications (such as Local Climate Zones) that can be "
"directly used for planning or as inputs of climate models. GeoClimate is "
"dedicated to this purpose: it converts raw geographical data "
"(OpenStreetMap and French BDTopo) into indicators useful for climate "
"applications (sky view factor, vegetation fraction, etc.) However, its "
"application is not limited to the climate field. The indicators "
"calculated in GeoClimate can also be used for other diagnostic or "
"planning purposes: studying the territory fragmentation, the influence of"
" the urban fabric on pollution (noise or air chemical transport), the "
"energy consumption, etc. GeoClimate is available as free and open source "
"geospatial software."

"Urban spatial properties are useful to study the urban climate: (i) basic"
" parameters such as building fraction or building height are needed as "
"input of parametric urban climate models such as the Town Energy Balance "
"( TEB)^[https://github.com/teb-model/teb] [@masson2000], (ii) more "
"sophisticated parameters are clearly correlated to urban climate "
"observations^[A few examples: (i) the lower the sky view factor, the "
"higher solar radiation trapped by the urban canopy [@bernabe2015], the "
"higher the urban air temperature [@lindberg2007], the lower the wind "
"speed [@johansson2016]; (ii) the higher the density of projected building"
" facade in a given direction, the lower the wind speed within the urban "
"canopy [@hanna2002].], and (iii) local climate classifications, useful "
"for international comparisons, are mostly defined from urban spatial "
"properties [@stewart2012]. Thus there is a need for tools dedicated to "
"the calculation of urban spatial metrics."

"In previous research, scripts were developed to automatically calculate "
"numerous indicators useful for urban climate applications [@bocher2018]. "
"These scripts have been organized, improved, and implemented within a "
"Groovy library called GeoClimate. New urban properties and classification"
" algorithms have been added. GeoClimate also simplifies access to "
"geospatial data since it automatically downloads and organizes data from "
"the worldwide OpenStreetMap database^[https://www.openstreetmap.org]. One"
" of the current major limitations for the climate community to use this "
"data is its lack of building height information [@masson2020]. Thus we "
"have also added an algorithm to roughly estimate the height of each "
"building missing this information."

"for any investigation dealing with urban climate issues (the calculation "
"of the Local Climate Zone is, for example, of major interest as metadata "
"for any urban climate study). The indicators calculated by GeoClimate can"
" also be used for territory diagnostic and planning purpose for any "

"The second step is the calculation of spatial indicators. GeoClimate "
"indicators are used to measure morphological properties (e.g., the form "
"factor) and describe spatial organizations (e.g., distance measurements, "
"patch metrics, shape index, spatial density). They quantify the shape and"
" pattern of urban and landscape structures. The spatial indicators are "
"computed at three scales: building, block, and RSU. Buildings are "
"characterized by their location in a geographical space (e.g., distance "
"to the nearest road, average distance to other buildings, number of "
"building neighbors). Building and blocks are characterized by "
"morphological indicators (e.g., a form factor), RSU are characterized by "
"fractions of land type (e.g., vegetation, water, impervious fractions) "
"and specific climate-oriented indicators (e.g., aspect ratio, mean sky "
"view factor). Some of the building indicators are also aggregated at "
"block scale (e.g., mean block height) and some of the building and block "
"indicators are aggregated at RSU scale (e.g., mean number of neighbors "
"per building, mean building height). In the end, more than 100 indicators"
" are calculated^[For further details about the available indicators and "
