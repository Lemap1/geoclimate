For command line interface
==========================

A GeoClimate package is compiled and publish after every change on the
code source on our Jenkins build.

Go to
`geoclimate-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies `__
to download it. This version contains all libraries and itâ€™s ready to
run the command line interface.
