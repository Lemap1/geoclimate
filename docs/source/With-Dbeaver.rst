View data with DBeaver
======================

You can view the generated database using DBeaver. To do this: - Open
DBeaver and create a new connection using the H2GIS Embedded driver. -
Select the .mv.db file generated by GeoClimate, located in the output
folder (*/tmp/test* in the example below). - Set the username to sa and
leave the password field empty. - Click Finish to establish the
connection and browse the database.

Now, you can display the content of every table of the database. If you
click on a cell that contains a geometry, it will display it on an
Openstreetmap background as in the picture bellow.
