msgid "GeoIndicators is the main module. It contains all the algorithms to build the units of analysis, compute the corresponding indicators and classify urban fabric by type. The *SpatialUnits* script creates the units of analysis (currently blocks and TSU). The *BuildingIndicators*, *BlockIndicators*, *RoadIndicators*, *RSUIndicators* calculate morphological and topographical indicators respectively at building, block, road, and RSU scales. The *GenericIndicators* script calculates indicators which can be applied to any scale (e.g., the area of a unit - building, block, RSU - or the aggregation of indicator from one scale to another - mean building height within a block or a RSU). The *TypologyClassification* script classifies units to a certain type (currently building to UTRF and TSU to LCZ) based on indicators value. The *DataUtil* script facilitates data handling (e.g., join several tables). All functions contained in the previous scripts may be called individually. To run several of them in a row, workflows are available in the *WorkflowGeoIndicators* script. The main one performs all the analysis (green arrows Figure 1): it produces the units of analysis, computes the indicators at the base scales (building and road), computes indicators at block scale, aggregates indicators from lower to upper scale, computes indicators at RSU scale, and then classifies urban fabric."

msgid "OSM module extracts and transforms the OSM data to the GeoClimate abstract model. These data processing steps are specified in the two scripts *InputDataLoading* and *InputDataFormating*. The *WorkflowOSM* script chains algorithms (blue arrow Figure 1): it triggers the 2 scripts dedicated to the OSM data preparation and then the *WorkflowGeoIndicators* script. It is the main entry to specify the area to be processed, the indicators, and the classifications to compute."
