msgid "To compute the whole indicators and classifications, GeoClimate uses the concept of Workflow to chain a set of spatial analysis and statistical processes. By default, the indicators are calculated at the TU scale (cf. subsection *Default TU scale calculation*) but optionally the user may aggregate indicators spatially at the scale of a grid of rectangular meshes (cf. subsection *Spatial aggregation using a regular grid*)."

msgid "The Workflow is organized in 3 steps (Figure 1). Note that each step or each process within a step can be run individually (cf. `section Coding implementation <Coding-implementation.html>`_). Note also that you can use the workflow even though you do not provide all input data. Partitioning and indicators calculations will be limited to the supplied data."

msgid "A RSU (Reference Spatial Unit), being the elementary unit to characterize all the characteristics of a piece of land (not only related to buildings but also to vegetation, water, sea, etc.) plus the urban functions (commercial, industrial, military, residential...). In the default case described here, Topographical Spatial Units (TSU) are used and they are defined as a continuous and homogeneous way to divide the space using topographic constraints based on road and railway center lines, vegetation, water and sea surface boundaries, administrative boundaries and urban function areas."

#: ../../Processing-steps.rst:18
msgid "The construction of the TSU is a key process in GeoClimate. First, a planar graph is built using all input geometries. The planar graph is then traversed to generate new polygons. Only 2D is considered for partitioning, therefore underground elements (such as tunnels), or overground (such as bridges) are excluded from the input. Water and vegetation surfaces are also excluded from the input data when they are smaller than a certain threshold, set by default to 2,500 m² for water and 10,000 m² for vegetation. Urban functions are described in the urban areas layer. As for water features, geometries with a surface area greater than 10,000 m² are excluded."
